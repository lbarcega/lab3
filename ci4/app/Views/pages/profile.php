			  <hr>

        My full name is Leila Angela B. Arcega. Leila is the name I use for most situations. 
        Angela is a very common name and a lot of people get mad when they call me when I don't notice because it's a really freaking common name.
        Also,  a lot of people tell me I don't act like my name at all - referring to "Angela". 
        They say I'm more the opposite of that or something. <span class="hide">(rude)</span> <br><br>

        I study Computer Science in Asia Pacific College because I can't make decisions and just ended up here for some reason. 
        I go with the flow because it's the easiest to do but when I find something I want to do, I go full force. 
        It's probably why I have <i>veeeery</i> high standards and get extremely competitve but only with specific things.
        Also apparently, I tend to submit weird stuff when instructions are vague - hey, like this website! <br><br>
        I mean I could just make a normal personal webpage but that's boring. What counts as a personal webpage anyway? Why am I just rambling here?
        God, I hate introductions, like, <i>so</i> much. No one even listens or reads these things. Even if they do it doesn't really matter. 
        No one remembers these things or at least I don't. So, what am I doing here at 11:44pm? I wanna lay down; my back hurts. <br><br>
